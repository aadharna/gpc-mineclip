## Installation

Make sure minedojo and mineclip are both installed on your system. This can be difficult. 
To verify, we have taken the validation scripts from `Minedojo` and `MineCLIP` and brought them into this repo.

Note, if you're using the docker container, you'll need to install mineclip yourself.
The docker container only comes with minedojo installed. 
To do so, run the following commands:

```bash
# inside the docker container

# pip install -e .
# or
python setup.py # this is probably the right way to get mineclip rather than the editable install above.
```
